                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                    <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                    <p>Before transitioning into technical writing, I served as a Senior Scientist for an international oil producer. In this role, I managed all aspects of planning, project management, operations, and application. Additionally, I engaged in private biosensor research and development, where I communicated complex technical information to investors and other key stakeholders, tailoring content for both technical and non-technical audiences.</p>

                    <h3>Where I am now</h3>
                    <p>I am a Senior Technical Writer specialising in API documentation, developer enablement, and technical content strategy. Since 2022, I have been the sole technical writer at Creditsafe, leading the transformation of our API documentation to enhance customer experience and streamline developer integration.</p>

            <h2>My Journey at Creditsafe</h2>
            <p>Creditsafe is a leading global provider of business credit risk and compliance solutions, with a database covering over 430 million businesses across more than 200 countries.</p>

            <p>Upon joining Creditsafe, I encountered minimal and unmanaged API documentation. Recognising the critical need for comprehensive, user-centric documentation, I took full ownership of the project. My approach is rooted in a customer-first philosophy: understanding client needs, assessing current development stages, and bridging the gap with clear, actionable knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
            <ul class="achievements-list">
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul:</strong><br><br> 
                    Independently audited and tested every API endpoint from a customer's perspective. Collaborated with product owners and development teams to ensure accuracy and relevance, creating all missing documentation single-handedly.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer-Centric API Portal:</strong><br><br>
                    Designed and developed a new API documentation portal that segments the API into individual products. Features include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive in-browser testing</li>
                        <li>Downloadable OpenAPI specifications</li>
                        <li>Multi-language code examples</li>
                        <li>Process flows</li>
                        <li>Product Specific Guides</li>
                        <li>Integrated feedback mechanisms to identify and address customer pain points</li>
                    </ul>
                    This initiative has significantly reduced customer inquiries, empowering users to integrate seamlessly without additional support.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Doc-as-Code Implementation:</strong><br><br>
                    Transitioned documentation to a Doc-as-Code approach, integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures real-time updates and maintains alignment with ongoing software developments.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Knowledge Empowerment:</strong><br><br>
                    Established a self-service API catalog for internal teams, standardising documentation processes and reducing dependencies on direct developer interactions.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Strategic Leadership</h2>
            <p>In my role, I engage with executive leadership to align documentation initiatives with Creditsafe's overarching business objectives. By collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I ensure that our documentation strategy supports product development and enhances customer satisfaction. This alignment has positioned our documentation as a strategic asset, driving product adoption and contributing to business growth.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Approach & Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe that exceptional documentation is the cornerstone of a positive user experience. By immersing myself in the user journey, I ensure that our documentation is not only informative but also intuitive and accessible. My goal is to make our API offerings fully self-service, minimising the need for external support.</p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>I am committed to continuous improvement and innovation. My future objectives include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing developer experience (DX)</li>
                <li>Integrating AI-driven solutions into documentation practices</li>
                <li>Conducting API usability research to further refine our offerings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I thrive on bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and user-friendly content, ensuring that our documentation serves as a powerful tool for both customers and developers.</p>
